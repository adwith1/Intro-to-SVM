# Intro-to-SVM
This repo contains my SVM project I created to implement a classifier in python. This project provides greater insight into how to classify complicated data with a high degree of dimensions or features. The dataset used for classification was a breast cancer data set and was interpreted by analyzing if a patient's tumor is benign or malignant. 
There are a variety of features analyzed from such as the mean radius, mean texture, symmetry, concavity and more. With these given features, I achieved an accuracy of 95.61%
using the SVM model.
